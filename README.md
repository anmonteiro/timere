# Timere
OCaml time handling and reasoning library

[API documentation](https://daypack-dev.github.io/timere/)

__Note__: The project core is largely complete, but still undergoing testing - you're welcome to use it in prototypes, but avoid using it in production for now. The NLP component is WIP.

__Disclaimer__: timere is not designed to handle prehistoric events. For prehistoric planning and booking software, please consult [appropriate experts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Flintstones).

## Examples

Christmases which fall on Wednesday from now

```ocaml
let () =
  let open Timere in
  match
    resolve (
      after (Date_time.now ())
      & months [`Dec]
      & days [25]
      & weekdays [`Wed]
    )
  with
  | Error msg -> failwith msg
  | Ok s ->
    Fmt.pr "%a@." (pp_intervals ~sep:(Fmt.any "@.") ()) s
```

gives

## Features

- Timestamp and date time handling with platform independent time zone support

  - Subset of the IANA time zone database is built into this library
  
- Reasoning over time intervals via `timere` objects/expressions, examples:

  - Pattern matching time and intervals. These work across DST boundaries.
  
  - Intersection and union

  - Chunking at year or month boundary, or in fixed sizes

  - Evaluate (sub)expressions with a different time zone (e.g. intersection of 9am to 5pm of Sydney and 9am to 5pm of New York)
    
## Usage

Include `timere` in the `libraries` stanza in your dune file, and optionally one of the following two to select
a concrete implementation of time zone data source

- `timere.tzdb.full`

  - This is the default implementation which embeds the IANA time zone database from year 1850 to year 2100 exclusive

- `timere.tzdb.none`

  - This embeds no database.
    This is suitable for when you want to retrieve time zone data during run time, for instance, to reduce the built artifact size.
  
  - The following resources should allow you to implement said approach readily
  
    - A usable and test suite covered data source is provided under `tzdb-json/`.
    
    - List of available time zones is available as `gen-artifacts/available-time-zones.txt`

    - `Time_zone.of_json_string` can load files in `tzdb-json/`

__Note__: While `tzdb-json/` may be useful and usable outside of Timere,
we make no guarantees that the JSON format stays unmodified
(though changes of the format should be a rare occurrence, if ever occurring)

## Acknowledgement

- Time zone information is extracted via `zdump` command output into `src/time_zone_data.ml`, using the IANA database (as time zone files) distributed on Linux

- Time zone data handling code copies approach used by [chrono-tz](https://github.com/chronotope/chrono-tz)

  - This includes data representation and choices of some algorithms
